GreenHarmony Webpage

Overview

This project is a responsive webpage for "GreenHarmony," a platform promoting eco-friendly living, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Color System


Primary (#2E7D32 - Forest Green): Represents trust and nature, aligning with the eco-friendly theme.


Secondary (#FBC02D - Warm Yellow): Conveys positivity and warmth for an inviting feel.


Accent (#D81B60 - Pink): Used for calls-to-action (e.g., form button) to draw attention with high contrast (WCAG AA compliant).

Breakpoint Logic



LG (1200px max-width): Matches the mockup's card sizes, spacing, and orientation with a 3-column layout for services/resources.


MD (768px): Switches to a single-column layout for services/resources, ensuring readability on tablets.


SM (480px): Further adjusts font sizes and padding for mobile usability, maintaining a single-column layout.

Creative Divergences



Theme: Rebranded from mental well-being to "GreenHarmony" for sustainability.


Content: Replaced placeholder text with eco-focused content (e.g., "Eco-Consulting," "Recycling Guides").


Navigation: Styled with a forest green background and hover effects using the secondary color for visual hierarchy.
